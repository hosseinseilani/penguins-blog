## NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THE WILD, CAMARONES REGRESSES AND BECOMES KRILL!

Krill is a Linux CLI system installer - still in development - that claims to be compatible with the great Calamares.

I'm trying to use Calamares' configuration files and "steal" what I can, from idea to code.

Of course it won't be the same thing - Krill is a different species - but it wants to be nice enough to users, just like Calamares is, and usable in desktop computers < 2 GB and any CLI-only system.

krill 0.0.2

krill 0.0.1

Krill is written in typescript and will be released ad Debian package.

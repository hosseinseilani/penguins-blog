[MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/) has its own remastering tools. I tried eggs on it, but in the end there is already what you need: the combination of mx-snapsnot and mx-installaer, and work great!

On [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/) and [Endeavour](https://endeavouros.com/) I have made some attempts. On Garuda the ```mkinitcpio``` configuration fail for me and on EndeavourOS - strange to say - I didn't find Calamares. It should probably be extremely easy to make eggs compatible with both, but it needs the cooperation of some hackers from the respective distros.

But the best part will be to bring eggs in [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)! Someone on line?

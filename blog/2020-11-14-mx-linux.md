## eggs-7.6.78

__Please note what this project is in no way connected to MX Linux in any official way, it's just my personal experiment__.

I am trying to port eggs to mx-linux.


At the moment I have managed to remaster mx-linux with eggs and reinstall it with calamares.

mx-linux has an excellent program for creating system snapshots. Furthermore, mx-linux has an excellent mx-installer installation program, with a graphical interface and a cli installer.

Both mx-snapshot and eggs are derived, with extensive modifications, from the same software: reftracta-snapshot by fsmithred.

Why bring eggs to mx if after all this distribution already has all the necessary tools?

A first reason could be to get familiar with their installer and make it available on other distributions. 

A second reason is that this distribution is based on the antiX scripts which are the most versatile as regards the possibility of installing linux on USB sticks with the possibility of having a system that can always be updated at hand.

At the moment I can only ensure that the snapshot creation with eggs and its installation with calamares will work with minor problems who I hope to solve soon.

We still have a long way to go ...

I have a new idea for eggs.

Eggs of course is not a package that is part of a distribution, moreover it is still relatively young. Waiting for it to end up in a repository would be long - not so much in truth - is present in the repository of ufficiozero.org, why not think about an autoupdate through this site?

It would be enough to provide the package with the list of versions, the text of the changelog to allow the user to decide and the download url.

It shouldn't be too difficult, nodejs is used for this purpose.

The idea, therefore, is to create a microservice that queries, provides:

- version
- changelog
- url

Does anyone want to cooperate? Any suggestions? 

Yes, it is born, and called basket!

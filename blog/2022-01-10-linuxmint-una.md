__You never forget your first love__

To tell the truth it's not quite true that linuxmint was my first love, initially I loved Knoppix and its KDE3 interface more and it didn't make me feel lonely in the unknown country.

But with the switch to KDE4 for a long time I found in cinnamon the favorite desktop and learned the name of Clement Lefebvre and his famous Linux Mint distribution.

So I have always considered Linux Mint even if derived from Ubuntu as a primary distribution and on the occasion of the release of version Una 20.3 I immediately made it compatible with eggs.

Actually, it was a long story. 

Before, to enable a link on the gnome desktop, it was enough to mark it with the right to run ``chmod a+x penguins-eggs.desktop``, but since some time, it was necessary to use ``gio``.

Either because I didn`t use gnome much, or because I must be so confused that I didn`t understand how this program works, until now gnome links always remained to be enabled.

Finally, the necessity to develop with eggs an important distribution made me look at the problem that can be said to be solved.

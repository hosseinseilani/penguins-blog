import Translactions from '@site/src/components/Translactions';

<Translactions />

I updated the manual today - only in [italian](/docs/tutorial-eggs/italiano) and [english](/docs/tutorial-eggs/english), _automatic and revised translation_ - and tried for the first time eggs with Ubuntu groovy gorilla. It seems to be going apart from a little problem with the calamares displaymanager module that at the moment I simply removed. (It only serves to manage the possible autologin). 

I tested the day realease on a UEFI machine, both iso production and install the system.

Is there anybody out there?

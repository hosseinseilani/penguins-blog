I updated the [manual](/book/) today - only in [italian](/book/italiano.html) and [english](/book/english.html), [brasilian](/book/portugues.html)  _automatic and revised translation_ - and tried for the first time eggs with Ubuntu groovy gorilla. It seems to be going apart from a little problem with the calamares displaymanager module that at the moment I simply removed. (It only serves to manage the possible autologin). 

I tested the day realease on a UEFI machine, both iso production and install the system.

Is there anybody out there?

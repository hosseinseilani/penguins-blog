You have to know that appetite comes with eating, so surprised by how quickly eggs was adopted by manjaro, I tried my hand at cinematography.

I made two videos, in the first we'll see the ease of installation of eggs in manjaro, its configuration and the production of an iso image.

The second video will show how to install the image obtained in another computer.

I hope I've managed, at least with sympathy!

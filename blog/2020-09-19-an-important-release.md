Same days ago I released eggs-7.6.39_1.deb

I resolved a lot of bugs, from the previos release 7.6.34.

This is an important version, in which a lot of work is completed, the reasons are the following:

Just finished the rewriting work. Well now we have officially Debian buster, Devual beowulf, Ubuntu focal and Ubuntu bionic fully supported, both for standard BIOS installation and UEFI installation, both on i386 and amd64 architecture.

Of course it follows that other derived distros can also be easily remastered: Linux Mint 20.20, Linux Mint 19.3, etc.

I also tried Deepin 20, which works perfectly, but only on standard BIOS machines

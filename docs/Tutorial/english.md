I cannot materially maintain two versions of the guide, so with regret, I refer you to the machine translation of the guide in Italian.

Normally the English version does not transform the code, finding it already in English, however for any doubts refer to the original version or the [README.md](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs#readme) of the [penguins-eggs](https://github.com/pieroproietti/penguins-eggs) repository.
